## GoRating

A rating system implemented in the language Go. The goal explicit is to provide
libraries for ratings generally for the Go language, but the implicity goal is
to use these ratings systems for the game Go (aka Baduk or Weiqi).

## Resources

The best resources are undoubtedly the Kaggle competitions on the subject:

* [Kaggle:FIDE Chess Ratings Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ChessRatings2)
    * [Winners' writeups](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ChessRatings2/forums/t/568/main-prizewinner-documentation/21222#post21222)
* [Kaggle:Chess Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chess)
* [TrueSkill](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/details.aspx)
* Netflix Prize for [Pragmatic Chaos](http://www.netflixprize.com//community/viewtopic.php?id=1537)
  and the [relevant technical writeup](http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_PragmaticTheory.pdf)

Another interesting approach: determining ratings based on one game! An
interesting idea. Maybe only possible for games like chess where the 
comupters are far better than humans.
